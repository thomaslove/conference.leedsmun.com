          <p>The year is 2020, and artificial intelligences have quickly become integral to the running of almost all of the worlds systems in recent years. After a series of electronic attacks on infrastructure targets around the world, no one is any closer
            to finding out who, or what, is behind these attacks. Join either the US or EU cabinet and prepare to investigate the attacks and deal with the perpetrators.</p>

              <p>Hi, I'm James from Manchester University and I will be your head director for crisis. I've been doing MUN for two and a half years now, with LeedsMUN 2014 being my first conference. I'm looking forward to being able to give all the crisis
                delegates and exciting and memorable weekend. </p>

              <h3>Ruchika Nongrum</h3>
              <p>Greetings fellow Model UN enthusiasts! My name is Ruchika Yadav Nongrum and I’m a second year Biomedical Science student at the University of Sheffield. I will be directing Crisis at LeedsMUN 2016 as part of the wonderful crisis staff and
                look forward to good quality debate and discussion. I have been MUNing since the age of 14 and over the years, have developed a great appreciation for the ideas and agendas discussed at Model UN conferences.</p>
              <p>After witnessing the flow of debate in a Model UN from all aspects, the conclusion is, I like crisis best as it involves quick thinking and an all-round knowledge of state and global policies. Even though I study a science degree, I am an
                avid debater of global politics and relations. I’m sure this year the Crisis team will deliver the best MUN experience to the delegates!</p>
