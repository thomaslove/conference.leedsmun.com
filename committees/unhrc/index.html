              <h4>The question of freedom of press and censorship in the digital age</h4>
              <p>This topic will focus on issues of freedom of press in the context of modern medias such as through the internet and social media; it is about defining and promoting the right of individuals and organisations to circulate opinions and communications,
                while also considering individual country's censorship and security laws which have traditionally inhibited on these liberties.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6 mt40">
              <h4>The question of the death penalty</h4>
              <p>Article 3 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights says : “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person”. Right to life focuses on the principle of having the right to live and not have your life taken away by another
                human being, with emphasis being on abortion, capital punishment etc.</p>
              <p>The death penalty is one of the most controversial issues in modern times in relation to Right to Life. Many states use death penalty as a means of punishment and deterrence for various crimes. But, we live in a world where many times we
                cannot come to consensus on which acts should actually be criminalized. While many oppose death penalty for being inhuman and cruel, the supporters would say its needed to tackle heinous crimes such a murders, rape and terrorism. Death
                Penalty and Right to Life have a very thin line between them.</p>

              <h4>Vaishnavi Sayal</h4>
              <p>Hello everyone! I’m Vaishanvi and I’m honored to be your Director for Human Rights Council at LeedsMUN 2016. I’m currently a final year Law student at Cardiff University and originally hail from New Delhi, India. I couldn’t be more ecstatic
                to be a part of HRC as human right issues has been my area of interest ever since I was a confused high school soul, whether it was being a part of my school environment council or volunteering with AIESEC in Mauritius for a month. </p>
              <p>My MUN journey started only 3 years back when I joined the CardiffMUN society but I have never looked back since. From being the quite shy delegate to the Secretary General of CardiffMUN 2016, MUN has helped me develop personally and intellectually.
                I hope you all have a similar experience of fun and growth. My wonderful Assistant Director Cecily and I will be there to guide you and to make HRC and LeedsMUN an amazing experience for you all! </p>

              <h4>Cecily Holt</h4>
              <p>Hello everyone! My name is Cecily, and I'm from Manchester, the best city in the world (except Leeds, of course). I'm a second year studying History at the University of Leeds.</p>
              <p>My first ever conference was LeedsMUN 2015, where I was a delegate in the UNHRC. I don't think I would have imagined at the time that one year on, I would in fact be the co-chair for the same committee! I am extremely excited to be a part
                of this, and I will endeavour to make the Human Rights Committee THE place to be this February. </p>
