              <h4>The Question of Global Internet Accessibility</h4>
              <p>Here in the developed world we tend to take Internet access for granted. However, over half of the world’s population does not have access to the Internet. Unequal access to the Internet is a major problem across the world, and is arguably
                a barrier to development and education for several millions of people. We aim to solve the problem of Internet provision in LEDCs, and in turn improve access to the Internet for millions of people worldwide.</p>

              <h4>Regulating the Dark Web</h4>
              <p>The Internet is, arguably, one of the most significant inventions of the past 30 years. Its influence and meteoric expansion have completely changed the face of human society in many ways. An increasing number sites exist on hidden and encrypted
                networks such as the Dark Web including online illegal drug marketplaces such as the Silk Road. Th e aims of this debate are to establish a framework for using the Dark Web, and what can be done in order to achieve agreed upon goals of
                enforcing the law on the Dark Web.</p>

              <p>Hello delegates! I’m Nia and I’ll be chairing ITU. I’m a third year International Relations and Politics undergraduate at The University of Sheffield, and have been a proud member of our MUN society since I was a fresher. I've been a delegate
                at 4 of the best conferences the UK has to offer, as well as Under-Secretary General for Logistics at SheffMUN 2015. When I'm not MUNning I'm usually doing musical theatre or working at our university's salad bar.</p>

              <h4>Robert Pomohaci </h4>
              <p>I'm a PhD student in Astrophysics here at the University of Leeds, originally from Romania. I joined MUN in my first year, and I haven't stopped debating since! Last year I took care of the fun side of the conference as USG Socials. Now
                I've moved to conference finances, taking on the role of USG Finance as well as one of your ITU chairs. You may have less official contact with me than with other secretariat, but you can be sure that I'll be there at the socials dragging
                everyone on to the dance floor!</p>
