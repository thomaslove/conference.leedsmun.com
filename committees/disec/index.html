              <h4>The question of the prevention of autonomous weapons</h4>
              <p>The question of autonomous weapons remains, so far, relatively unanswered. The rise in the use of armed and unarmed drones has led to numerous discussions and arguments about their usage, however, the majority of these have focused around
                human remote-controlled UAVs. Programmed autonomous drones, or indeed in the future land based weaponised rovers, raise numerous questions of accountability, ethics and control. In a growing digital age, where wars are increasingly fought
                from control rooms rather than on the ground, autonomous weapons could be the next step in the journey. Topics focused around areas where technology is still very new or is a future possibility, have been debated and agreed upon by the
                UN before, and have provided us with some iconic resolutions and conventions. This topic, therefore, we hope will provide a invigorating topic for the LeedsMUN DISEC Committee. </p>

            <div class="col-lg-6 mt40">
              <h4>The Question of Disputes in the South China Sea</h4>
              <p>The South China Sea has been a heavily disputed body of water for centuries; with China, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines and Brunei all holding territorial claims. In recent years the military and naval presence in
                the sea has escalated, leading to an increasingly volatile situation. China’s building of an oil rig and artificial islands have been widely criticised by the international community. The USA have answered China’s claims of total sovereignty
                by sending warships, and other states in the area have appealed to the UN to diffuse the situation. All of these factors contribute to make the issue a challenging topic for the DISEC committee to consider</p>

              <h4>Andreas Payne</h4>
              <p>My name is Andreas Payne and I will once again be the Head Chair of DISEC at LeedsMUN16, having done the role at last year’s LeedsMUN too! I am a third year student at the University of Kent reading Politics & International Relations, with
                my dissertation focus being on the role of the UN in conflict situations. I have eight years worth of MUN experience, having been a delegate, chair, President of the SC and Secretary-General. I have also been invited to numerous schools
                to help with the setting up and running of their own conferences, including to trips abroad to Kazakhstan and the USA. Outside of the MUNiverse (!!) I enjoy cooking (and occasionally sharing the results with my family and friends), eating
                out, and a good bottle of wine!</p>

              <h4>Martha McKenna</h4>
              <p>Hello everyone! I'm Martha McKenna, and I'm very excited to be taking the position on co-chair for DISEC at LeedsMUN16! I'm studying international business at the University of Leeds. I've been a part of MUN for three years, and though I
                have chaired at several conferences I'm particularly looking forward to LeedsMUN as it will be my fist time chairing at university level. I'm also looking forward to meeting you all and enjoying a weekend of great debate!</p>
