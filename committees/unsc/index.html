              <h4>The question of the use of the internet by terrorist groups</h4>
              <p>In an age where the technology is becoming increasingly accessible around the word, terrorist groups such as Daesh (ISIS) are able to strengthen themselves, managing to spread ideology and recruit sympathisers around the world. It is vital
                that member states come together to find a solution to this issue, looking at the use of the internet by recruiters as well as those being recruited, in order to combat a phenomenon which is threatening global security.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-6 mt40">
              <h4>The Question of Sexual Violence in Conflict Zones</h4>
              <p>Conflict-related sexual violence has been a feature of war for generations worldwide, with most victims consisting of children. The lasting effects of such experiences are severe, inflicting considerable physical and emotional damage on
                individuals, while also diminishing whole community structures. Whilst this issue has reached the top priority in the international agenda, there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done, thus Member States must devise a programme
                of efficient responses, in order to combat this great moral issue of our time.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone! My name is Katie Kapodistria and I am very proud to introduce myself to you as your Vice President of the Security Council! I'm from the tiny island of Cyprus, and I'm currently in my first year at the University of Manchester
